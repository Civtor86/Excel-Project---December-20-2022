Task description
Amazon India is trying to analyze their transaction data  
regarding delivery information. As an analyst, you will help  
them explore the data extracted from the system by creating  
a report with data storytelling. This report will be shared  
with senior management, so the information should be  
clear and accurate.

Questions:
Does the company have a stable transaction trend? Show the answer  
on a month to month basis.

What can we tell about the distribution status between the regions  
and in terms of returned items?

How does the shipping fee differ between regions? Can we find any  
other insights about the shipping trends?
